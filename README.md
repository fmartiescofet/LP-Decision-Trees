# Haskell Decision Tree for Mushroom Dataset

Project of Programming Languages subject in Barcelona School of Informatics, FIB - UPC.
Fall 2020-2021.

This project consists of an implementation of a decision tree for the [Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) to decide if a mushroom is *edible* or *poisonous*.
The data used for the decision tree construction is in `agaricus-lepiota.data`and information about the meaning of each attribute can be found in `agaricus-lepiota.names`.

## Getting started
To run this program you only need `ghc` installed. You can check [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) for installation instructions.

To compile the code:
```bash
ghc dts.hs
```

To run the code:
```bash
./dts.hs
```

## About the implementation
The used algorithm to build the decision tree is specified in the following document:
Gerard Escudero, 2020. [Machine Learning(p.35-40)](https://gebakx.github.io/ml/#35)
If there is a tie of the accuracy between different attributes I choose the one which classifies more examples in poisonous or edible by using the `computeNFiltered` function, and if there's still a tie I choose the one with bigger index.

The decision tree is implemented as an algebraic `data` type which can either be a `Node String [(Char,DTree)]` which contains the decision attribute and all the possibilities or a `Leaf String` which contains if the mushroom is *edible* or *poisonous*.

I've decided to work with the datset as a matrix where each row is an attribute and each column is a mushroom so it's easier to work with it.

All used functions are documented in the code.
